# Refactoring Context

## Current Phase: Phase 2 (Shared Defaults/Storage)
We are currently moving away from duplicated `DEFAULTS` objects towards a centralized module in `extension/shared/`.

## Refactoring Guidelines
1. **Reference docs/refactoring-plan.md** for detailed steps.
2. **Phase Order:** Follow the phases sequentially. Do not skip ahead.
3. **Safety First:** Write tests for existing behavior BEFORE making any changes.
4. **Incremental:** Make small, testable commits.

## Progress Tracking
- ✅ Phase 1: Testing Infrastructure (COMPLETED)
- 🔜 Phase 2: Shared Defaults/Storage (IN PROGRESS)
- 📋 Phase 3-7: Planned (see refactoring-plan.md)
