        <p>This is a much longer article with more content. It has multiple paragraphs and should be detected as the longest article when that setting is enabled.</p>
        <p>Here's another paragraph with even more text to make sure this is definitely the longest article on the page.</p>
        <p>And a third paragraph for good measure!</p>
