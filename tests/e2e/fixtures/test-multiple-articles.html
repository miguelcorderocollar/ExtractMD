  <body>
    <article>
      <h2>First Article</h2>
      <p>This is a short article with minimal content.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Second Article (Longest)</h2>
      <p>
        This is a much longer article with more content. It has multiple paragraphs and should be
        detected as the longest article when that setting is enabled. The content script requires at
        least 500 characters of text content to recognize an article element as valid content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's another paragraph with even more text to make sure this is definitely the longest
        article on the page. We need to ensure there's enough substance here for the detection
        algorithm to properly identify this as meaningful content worth extracting.
      </p>
      <p>
        This third paragraph adds additional context and information. When users want to extract
        content from a page with multiple articles, the extension should be able to handle it
        gracefully and provide options for which article to extract or extract all of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        And a fourth paragraph for good measure to ensure we exceed the 500 character threshold!
