# Chrome Web Store Publishing Checklist

**Last Updated: December 2025**

This checklist covers all requirements for publishing ExtractMD to the Chrome Web Store as of December 2025.

## ✅ Pre-Submission Requirements

### 1. Developer Account Setup

- [x] Create a Google account (if not already have one)
- [x] Register as a Chrome Web Store developer
- [x] Pay the one-time registration fee ($5 USD as of 2025)
- [x] Verify developer account email address
- [x] Complete developer profile with accurate contact information

### 2. Extension Technical Requirements

#### Manifest V3 Compliance ✅

- [x] Using Manifest V3 (`manifest_version: 3`)
- [x] Service worker instead of background page (`background.service_worker`)
- [x] Content Security Policy compliant
- [x] No inline scripts or eval()

#### Code Quality

- [x] Extension tested thoroughly on latest Chrome version
- [x] No crashes or broken features
- [x] All permissions properly justified (see Permissions section below)
- [x] Code is minified/bundled for production (`npm run build:prod`)
- [x] Source maps removed from production build (or kept for debugging)

#### Permissions Justification

The extension currently requests:

- `activeTab` ✅ - Needed to access current tab content for extraction
- `storage` ✅ - Needed to save user settings and preferences
- `clipboardWrite` ✅ - Needed to copy extracted Markdown to clipboard
- `scripting` ✅ - Needed to inject content scripts dynamically
- `host_permissions: <all_urls>` ✅ - **JUSTIFIED** (see below)

**`<all_urls>` Justification:**
ExtractMD includes a Universal Article Extractor that allows users to extract Markdown from **any webpage**, not just YouTube and Hacker News. This enables users to copy content from blogs, documentation sites, news articles, and any other web content. The extension only processes content when the user explicitly requests extraction—it does not run automatically or collect any browsing data.

> **Store Listing Text (copy this to Privacy tab):**
> "The `<all_urls>` permission is required because ExtractMD includes a Universal Article Extractor feature that enables Markdown extraction from any website. This allows users to extract content from blogs, documentation, news sites, and other web pages beyond the built-in YouTube and Hacker News integrations. The extension only activates when users explicitly request extraction and does not automatically access or collect any browsing data."
